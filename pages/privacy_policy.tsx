				<strong>1. information we collect</strong>
				<br />● unidentified and non-identifiable information (“anonymous
				information”) does not enable leap.club to identify the visitor from
				whom it was collected. the anonymous information that leap.club may
				collect consists of: (1) the date, time and length of your visit,
				including how much content you viewed (in the aggregate); (2) your
				internet browser, operating system or internet service provider; and (3)
				what parts of the application you used and for how long. leap.club may
				aggregate, use and share anonymous information with third parties for
				marketing and advertising purposes.
				<br />
				● log-in data and additional personal information. you have the option
				to submit your information to apply to be a leap.club member, which we
				use to screen new applicants and may use to send announcements about
				major updates. your first and last name, email address, and company, is
				individually identifiable information, meaning information that can
				identify an individual or may, with reasonable efforts, lead to the
				identification of an individual (“pii”). pii may also be collected in
				creating a profile on the leap.club app. if any anonymous information is
				linked to pii, it is treated as pii as long as the connection exists.
				<br />● content You Share. This comprises all of the information you
				make available to other users via Platform, comprising such as:
				Information about you or relating to you that is voluntarily shared by
				you on the Platform, including without limitation, any quotes, images,
				political opinions, religious views, etc.
				<br />
				chat Data. We collect the content of any communications between you and
				another user, when you use any chat feature on the Platform. This is
				stored on your device and the devices of the users that you have sent
				communications to. However, we do not monitor your chat data, take any
				action based on your chat data or disclose it to any third party.
				<br />
				<br />

				other related information. We also collect data on the specific pages of
				our Platform that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time

				similar usage related statistics. We may assign each user of the
